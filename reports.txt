log_incomemodel -> log median house value vs median income. R^2=0.4284.

income_model where you're plotting median house value vs median income is better :( r^2=0.4734

actually the residuals are better???


sexy_model <- log_median_house_value ~ data$median_income ++ housing_median_age + exp_distance_to_los_angeles + exp_distance_to_san_francisco
